To make use of Flamingo-4 flash code you need to convert the config file because there are some components that are moved to a cmc folder.
To make it a bit easier you can use a simple configuration convertor:

or use the code in the repository:

The old .swf files need to be removed and the new one's needs to be placed in the correct directory. Make sure you first REMOVE all .swf files and then paste the new ones in the correct directory. Otherwise old .swf files wil be used.
